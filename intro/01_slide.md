# Lessons Learned from the Rails Rumble
## or, "How to successfully pull off Thanksgiving dinner"

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Me
* Use Java at Work
* Use Ruby at Home
* Very understanding girlfriend :)

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# What are we talking about?
* Lessons from completing the Rumble
* What worked
* What didn't
* Can we apply any of this to our jobs?

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Rails Rumble
* 48 hours
* Any app you want
* Fully deployed
* Nothing digital beforehand

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Why?
* See if I could do it (I did)
* See if I could win (I didn't)
* Write an app I always wanted to write

!SLIDE  bullets incremental
# Carl the Robot
* Programming Game
* Based on Karel The Robot
* Learn the basics of programming
* Completely Visual/Drag-n-Drop

!SLIDE
# VERY Brief Demo

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# How to get started?
* Plenty of time to prepare
* Have limited time to get the job done
* Want to impress
* Can't fail

!SLIDE 
# This sounds familiar...

!SLIDE 
# Thanksgiving!

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Prepare
* Gather Recipes _(maybe even try some of them out ahead of time)_
* Prep everything
* Get organized
* Cook

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Gather Recipes
* Karel programming language
* Drag-n-drop UX
* Deployment
* Make CSS not suck

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Karel
## [rkarel](http://github.com/davetron5000/rkarel)
* Ruby DSL
* Full implementation of Karel
* Ended up using 0% of this

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Drag-n-Drop UX
* Read JQuery docs
* Created a tile-based RPG map maker

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Drag-n-Drop UX
* Verifed that JQuery DnD would work
* Obviously didn't use any of this code

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Deployment
* Bought a Linode slice
* Set it up, with meticulous notes - 44 step process
* Deleted the node and did it again
* Allowed my root-password to get compromised and a DDOS was launched!  Added step #45.
* Had one-command deployment done by the second hour

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Make CSS not suck
* Built rails app for my iPhone App
* [Compass!](http://compass-style.org/)
* Blueprint
* Still fought with my grid up until the end

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Prep Everything
* No digital assets
* Pen and Paper
* Wireframes
* even some UML!

# Get Organized
<img src="thanksgiving_list.jpg" />

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Get Organized
* Went through all drawings
* Discarded irrelevant ones
* Posted relevant ones
* Grouped by purpose
* <span style="color:green">Green &#x2714;</span> means "done", <span style="color:red">Red &#x2715;</span> means "won't do"

# Time to Cook
## I made the following plan:
* 1 - Get deployment set up
* 2 - Implement user auth
* 3 - ???
* 4 - Have entire app completed with a few hours to spare

!SLIDE 
# So, how did it go?

!SLIDE
# Deployment and Auth went easily 

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Back-end code
* Test-driven code went quickly, gave me no problems
* Non-test-driven code was a timesuck

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Front-end
* Didn't think out my grid
* Constant battles with it
* JQuery DnD went smoothly...
* ...but didn't account for complex UX

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Oh, and game levels?
* Spent *no* time on them until the last *hour*
* Only ended up with a small #
* How *does* one deal with reference data?

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# What got done?
* Basic UI
* Mechanics of gameplay
* Viable demonstration of concept

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# What got left out?
* Various conditions
* Subroutines
* More levels
* Tutorial/Help System

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Lessons?

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# For the Rumble
* Don't be so ambituous
* Plan ahead
* Think about contingencies

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# For work?
* Prototyping works
* TDD
* *Some* design up front is OK

!SLIDE bullets
# Totally doing it again next year
